      <p> My journey starts when I was eight years old. I can remember when my mother left us, that I
    stopped speaking. I quickly started to learn ways to change the way I felt inside; I stole
    things from shops and started to tell lies.
         </p>
      <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
          The first time I was cautioned by the police for shoplifting was not long after mum left. All the
time whilst in the police car and during the interview I still had a stolen Sega Master System
game stashed in the back of my jacket and it gave me a sense of greatness thinking I was
smarter than the police. This was soon to be a common theme.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
          A few years later I was caught stealing money from my dad. He didn't know what to do with
me and my brothers were saying how out of order I was. I felt so ashamed and never even
really knew why I took the money. I was due to go to my mum's that weekend but instead I
took some bottles of my dad's wine and some codeine painkillers and made my way to the
back of Coate Water lakes. I was 12 years old and something in me had clicked; to kill
myself was my purpose in life so I took the pills and drank the wine. It was getting late and I
had been sick. I was starting to feel like it wasn't working so I started to tie my hands and
feet together with my shoe laces. I rolled off the bank and into the lake but I couldn't keep
myself under the water.</p>
         <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
          It was the early hours of the morning by now and it was dark and cold, I managed to crawl
out and as I stood up I saw a figure of a man and he said to me “I will not let you die” I then
walked to the telephone box and called for an ambulance.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
          Straight away I started to tell people that I had seen Jesus! But soon enough it wouldn't
matter because life to me had no purpose. It wasn't long before I started smoking cannabis
in the park with my brother and his mates but I quickly went to using as often as possible
which became the norm for me and my mates. Things quickly developed when I started
going to rave parties where the drugs were acid, LSD, amphetamines, ecstasy and cocaine.
I particularly took a lot of LSD due to the fact that it was so cheap. I was working from a very
young age so I learned that earning money would enable me to buy more drugs but
eventually experimentation led to heroin which I injected on the second occasion and that
was that. I was using daily and shoplifting daily to fund it.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
          That is when I ended up in front of a judge frequently for various crimes, but because of the
addictive nature of heroin and crack cocaine it got to the stage where I'd always lose my job
so in the end I made a vow, “no more paid employment just crime” so it wasn't long before I
was off to prison for the first time and then ultimately I ended up going to prison six times.</p>
           <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
           On my final visit (I didn’t know it was to be my last visit then), things went very wrong and not
how my other visits had gone. I was 29. I was assaulted in a way that can’t be mentioned
here. Anger and shame consumed me. I needed to get revenge which impacted upon my
mental health. I kept having violent thoughts, not only towards others, but to myself. I knew
then that if I ended up in prison again I would do something I’d regret.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
           When I got out I started using again but something was very different, I started to meet
people who were talking about forgiveness and God.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
           After another restless, sleepless night, I walked into Christ Church with a mixture of curiosity,
apprehension and excitement. An older lady came to greet me with warmth and I felt at
peace, and then I understood that nothing bad could come out of this new venture.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
           I started going to Narcotics Anonymous, Cocaine Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous. I
submerged myself fully into the ’12 Steps’ which quickly became my way of life. I realised
though that members can’t share the saving knowledge and grace of Salvation in Christ to
others in case it goes against their own beliefs. I also struggled with interacting with anyone
other than drug addicts – we shared similar humour, backgrounds, family issues, lives – and
with anyone else I felt isolated and alien. By this time I had managed to get a flat of my own
but I also spent a lot of time on my own too.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
           I found I had an interest in computers and learning, but unfortunately with that I also found
porn. I called sex lines and ultimately ended up visiting prostitutes. My view of women was
very unhealthy coupled with confused thoughts: an attraction, curiosity and a lust for male
and female. I've always been a curious person fulfilling the promise to try anything once,
thankfully I didn't get to try everything! But my sex addiction and loneliness led me to seek
out prostitutes and I walked into some dangerous situations leaving places knowing some of
these women could not even speak English and probably were here illegally or even held
against their will. It was a very desperate and dark time in my life. It was even darker than
drug addiction and prison life.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
            It took being ambushed by a sex worker and her boyfriend to knock any sense into me. They
were after my money, but luckily I managed to get away. It could have ended so badly – but I
had a Christian friend who came to my aid. After a long and rocky road, I found myself
healed; healed from anger, from revenge, from sex and porn addiction, and began to have a
more healthier outlook on life.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
            Around this time I met an evangelist who told me what Jesus said in the Bible about the
need to be born again and what it means to repent of my sin. I was still in my 12 Steps
program, but my faith in Christ was getting stronger every day. I started to read the Bible,
which changed my heart towards God. I became utterly devoted to Him and His work; I said
to God, ‘if your Word is true and the healings of the Bible are true then I'm going to see if you
are trustworthy by leaving the 12 step recovery program and all the lifestyle that surrounds it,
and I will follow you Lord.’ I burnt books of other practices I had been following, I destroyed
horror movies and 18 rated material in my home. I committed my life to him and chose to
trust him. I truly felt I had been Born Again.</p>
        <p class="collapse" id="block-id">
            Now my life is dramatically different, I have worked with homeless people, drug addicts and
alcoholics, adults with learning difficulties. My wife and I helped to start the Swindon Night
Shelter. I have two daughters and life is awesome!! I still struggle plenty but now I am not
alone!! I am bathed constantly in the glow of Christ.
